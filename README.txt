HELLOOOO,

let me explain what my project does,

This is a simple python based chess game implemented using classes, objects, list, dictionaries loops etc. the game has two modes and single player mode and a double player mode, to play single player press 1 at the start of the game and to play double player game (play with a friend).


 The game works by stating your initial place such e2 and state your end place example e3 (this e2 to e3 will for example will move the pawn in the e2 spot to the e3 spot).


 The pawns are marked as p , the king as k, the queen as q, rook as r, knight as n, and bishop as b
